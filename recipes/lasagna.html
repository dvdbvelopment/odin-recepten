    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Indulge in the comforting embrace of a classic lasagna that promises layers of rich flavors and a symphony of textures. This timeless recipe transforms simple ingredients into a culinary masterpiece that's perfect for gatherings or cozy family dinners. The journey begins with delicate sheets of freshly cooked lasagna noodles, providing a sturdy foundation for the layers to come. A velvety, aromatic tomato sauce kissed by hints of basil and oregano blankets the first layer, infusing the dish with an unmistakable Italian essence.</p>

    <p>Nestled between each saucy stratum is a medley of indulgence - creamy ricotta cheese blended with Parmesan, egg, and chopped spinach, imparting both richness and a vibrant green hue. Tender slices of mozzarella cheese drape over this mixture like a luscious blanket, its gooey goodness turning golden and bubbling in the oven's heat. The ensemble wouldn't be complete without a hearty helping of finely seasoned ground beef or a vegetarian alternative like sautéed mushrooms and zucchini. As the layers continue to stack, each bite becomes a harmonious crescendo of flavors, from the slightly tangy tomato tang to the earthy richness of the cheese and the savory depth of the meat. Baked to perfection, the lasagna emerges from the oven with a tantalizing aroma that beckons all to gather around the table, eagerly awaiting the moment when fork meets lasagna, and indulgence knows no bounds.</p>

    </ul>
    <li>Preheat the oven:</li>
